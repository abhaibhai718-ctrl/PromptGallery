    <h1>My Prompts</h1>

    <div class="card" data-prompt="A realistic, wide-angle POV selfie photo.

The person on the left is me, using the attached reference image only for my exact face, facial features, hairstyle, skin tone, and sunglasses. Do not take clothing, accessories, or phone details from the reference image.

I am wearing a complete football match-day outfit suitable for a night stadium event: an Argentina national team–style football jersey with sky blue and white vertical stripes and a short-sleeve athletic fit, paired with dark slim-fit jeans and clean white sneakers. The outfit looks realistic, casual, and appropriate for a live football crowd, with no extra accessories or layers.

I am holding a Samsung S25 Ultra Silverblue smartphone in my right hand, slightly above eye level, arm extended forward, clearly taking a selfie. The phone has a premium silver-blue finish, flat edges, and a multi-lens rear camera setup, visible naturally in a realistic smartphone selfie grip.

My head is slightly tilted toward Lionel Messi, with a natural excited smile, like a genuine fan moment.

I am standing next to Lionel Messi, who is wearing a plain black short-sleeve T-shirt, smiling naturally at the camera and leaning slightly toward me to fit into the selfie frame.

Around us is a chaotic crowd of Indian police officers wearing white police uniforms with peaked caps, escorting Messi through the area.

The background shows a massive, fully packed football stadium at night, illuminated by bright floodlights, creating a high-energy match atmosphere.

The image should look candid and spontaneous, like a real smartphone selfie, with slightly imperfect framing, subtle motion blur in the background, natural lighting, and realistic depth.

Maintain photorealistic facial details, accurate proportions, and a genuine fan-moment vibe.

Style: ultra-realistic, smartphone photography, wide-angle lens, night stadium lighting." onclick="copyPrompt(this)">
